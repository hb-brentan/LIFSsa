It is software useful for spectral analysis developed with an educational proposition for learning the python programming language. The main code captures a CSV spectral file of a soil sample and returns its area, the height of the pick, and the spectral graph. We use python 3.8 and some python libraries as matplotlib, scipy, numpy, and pandas.
